# Scheduler
This project is a perosonal side project looking to find a way to allow managers at colleges to quickly draft a semester course schedule based on faculty preferences. This was a real problem when I worked at a community college at there were several variables to consider
- day/time availabilty
- course modality (e.g., online or in person)
- course (e.g., general chemistry)
- campus preference
- manager vs faculty preference
The goal of this project was to make a quick way to find the best course/faculty combinations while also getting me to learn advanced python skills such as
- using dataframes and table joins
- creating data classes
- building functions
- creating my own libraries
- creating logs and audit files
I'll try to update my progress regularly, but what's here is the file as of my last update, so the code is nowhere near to operational but I expected this project to take a while - there are really a lot of things in the backlog to be done, not counting unit tests and debugging.
